I'm Kostas Giannousis. A software man at [Transifex](https://transifex.com). I would say about me that:

- I work out regularly (but I am not considering myself fit)
- I'm always on a diet (but not losing a gram) and looking for a tasty and weird recipe
- I'm extremely loyal to my family and my friends


My projects this period are about:

- Kubernetes (CKAD done, next is preparation for CKA)
- Preparation for AWS certification
- Some development and updating this site

What else do you need?
