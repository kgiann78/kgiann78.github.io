I'm Kostas Giannousis. A software man at [Transifex](https://transifex.com). What more could I say about me?

- I'm working out regularly, but I am not considering myself fit
- I'm on constant diet, but I'm not losing a gram because I always look for tasty and weird recipes
- I'm loyal to family and friends


My projects this period are about:

- Experiment with Kubernetes
- Preparation for AWS certification
- Some development here and there

What else do you need?
