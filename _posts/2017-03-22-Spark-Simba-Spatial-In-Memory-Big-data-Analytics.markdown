# Simba Spatial In-Memory Big data Analytics using Spark

Simba is a great tool to use spatial data with Spark SQL.

Original repo is at [InitialDLab/Simba](https://github.com/InitialDLab/Simba).


* Update Simba to use Spark 2.1. 
  
  o The guys from InitialDLab seem to work towards that so it might not be necessary.
* Run Simba using JDBC.
 
  o Usefull link is found at [JavaWorld: Create your own type 3 JDBC driver](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074249/data-storage/create-your-own-type-3-jdbc-driver--part-1.html)
