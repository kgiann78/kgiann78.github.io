As a developer (or not) you may have heard the expression above. 
It's very common to be in a state where you feel stuck in a problem
and you need to ask somebody for help. 

And as soon as you start expressing your problem, new ideas start appearing
out of the blue!

Well this is where the duck is coming handy! Instead of finding someone else,
you start talking to the duck and (maybe) ideas are start flowing again!

And a rubber duck can be very cute and handy, but today's post is all about
an interactive terminal duck!

Before starting working with this, I bumped into two repositories that kinda
were doing what I wanted to... One was a 
[rubber ducky chatbot for slack](https://github.com/s-wigg/Rubber-Ducky-Chatbot)
in python and the other was a 
[rubber duck app for terminal](https://github.com/kaicataldo/rubberducky) in javascript. 

Yet another one rubber duck app? For start I need to practice my dev 
skills in Python. And secondly, I love the idea of having a chatbot 
rubber ducky for slack but that's not feasible now.

So, I thought, why not combining the two of them?

And there it was born my rubber ducky for terminal! Based on the 
functionallity of the chatbot ducky I have changed a couple of 
things that weren't working anymore and I worked in order to 
figure out what the original creator had in mind and 
make it my own and produce a great terminal app too.
